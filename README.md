# Flare
An adaptive Gnome shell theme which keeps a lot of design elements from
Adwaita and brings some of the elements from the default
Unity theme. It is an attempt to make Ubuntu with Gnome feel more
familiar, but at the same time more modern.

## Colors
Official Ubuntu colors were used throught the theme in order to keep the feel of the Ubuntu brand.

## Material
The use of blur brings better contrast between the background and the overview items. Many design
elements are now using translucent material in order to blend better with all kinds of different backgrounds
and colors.
